# Ngrok.AspNetCore
Extensions to start Ngrok automatically from the AspNetCore pipeline. Useful to enable for local development when a public URL is needed.

## Setting it up

Add `AddNGrok` to your service registration

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddNGrok();
}
```

You also need to call `UseNGrok` in your `Program` class when making the builder.

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(x => x
            .UseStartup<Startup>()
            .UseNGrok(/* optional options here */));
```

When the application starts up, NGrok will launch automatically and create a tunnel to the application. 

If NGrok is not installed, it will be downloaded automatically to the execution directory.

### Inferring the application URL
If you don't specify a `ApplicationHttpUrl` property in the options when calling `AddNGrok`, you have to insert the following call in your `Startup` class' `Configure` method:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseNGrokAutomaticUrlDetection();
}
```

## Getting the exposed URL
Simply inject an `INGrokHostedService` and call its `GetTunnelsAsync` method.

`INGrokHostedService` also has a `Ready` event that you can listen to, if you'd rather like that.

## Configuration
NGrok can be configured when registering it in the services collection by passing in an `NGrokOptions` instance in the `AddNGrok` method

#### NGrokOptions
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ApplicationHttpUrl | The local URL to proxy to. If not provided, it will default to the first HTTP URL registered. It should work fine automatically when hosted from kestrel. Haven't tested in IIS. |
| ShowNGrokWindow | Whether the NGrok window will be shown. Useful for debugging purposes. |
